## Description

This repository contains the implementation and experimental code accompanying the paper *Rigid-Body Orientation Using Unit Quaternions*. The project studies the mathematical representation of three-dimensional rigid-body orientation using unit quaternions and evaluates their numerical behavior and computational efficiency. Rotation matrices are included as a reference representation for validation purposes.

## Installation
