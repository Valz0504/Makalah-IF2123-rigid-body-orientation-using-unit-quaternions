Rigid-body orientation in three-dimensional space is essential for robotics, computer graphics, and aerospace applications. Traditional Euler angles suffer from gimbal lock, while rotation matrices are computationally redundant and numerically unstable. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical study of unit quaternions as an alternative representation. The theoretical foundations of quaternion algebra are developed, establishing the correspondence with SO(3) through axis-angle representation and the sandwich product. To validate these theoretical properties, computational experiments are conducted using Python implementations for unit quaternions representation, with rotation matrices included as a reference representation to support empirical
validation, examining numerical stability and computational efficiency. \\
